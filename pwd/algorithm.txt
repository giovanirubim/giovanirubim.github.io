Generation Algorithm

1. Encode the password

	1.1. An array of bytes is generated from the password using utf-8
	encoding

	1.2. The array must be converted in a string of ones and zeros in
	a little endian way

	1.3. The stirng resulted if not a multiple of six must be padded
	with zeros until it becames a multiple of six

	1.4. Each six bit must be encoded using base64

2. Encode the pattern

	2.1. Enumerate each point of the pattern with an hexadecimal digit
	where the top-left is "0", the next one to the right is "1" and so
	on

	2.2. Concatenate the digits reached by the pattern in the
	respective order

3. Encode the use

	3.1. Trim the string of the use, remove duplicate spaces and
	covert all characters to lower case

	3.2. Encode to base64 following the same steps used to encode the
	password
